## Introduction

This repository documents my learning experience with Golang context, as taught in the Programmer Zaman Now course. Golang context is a crucial aspect of concurrent programming in Go, allowing for proper management of resources and graceful cancellation of operations.

## Course Overview

Programmer Zaman Now provides a comprehensive course on Golang context, covering topics such as:

- Understanding the importance of context in Go applications.
- Creating and using context objects.
- Managing timeouts and deadlines in concurrent operations.
- Handling context cancellations and errors gracefully.
- Implementing context-awareness in your Go code.

## Getting Started

To get started with the materials in this repository, make sure you have Golang installed on your system. You can visit the [official Golang website](https://golang.org/dl/) to download and install Go.

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tamathecxder/golang-context.git
```

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the relevant sections and explore the code samples and documentation.

## Key Concepts

In your journey to master Golang context, it's essential to grasp the following key concepts:

* Context: Understanding what context is and how it works in Go.

* Background Context: Learning how to create a background context, which serves as the parent context for all other contexts.

* WithCancel, WithTimeout, and WithDeadline: Exploring different ways to create derived contexts with various cancellation mechanisms.

* Context Values: Understanding how to store and retrieve values in a context.

## Examples

The 'examples' directory in this repository contains practical code examples and illustrations of Golang context usage. These examples will help you solidify your understanding of the concepts discussed in the course.
